# Tournament Admin System

## Overview
The tournament now has a comprehensive admin system that controls who can edit scores and manage tournament settings without requiring traditional authentication. This keeps the system simple while preventing unauthorized changes.

## Features

### üîê Admin Access Control
- **Passcode-based authentication**: No user accounts needed, just simple passcodes
- **Session persistence**: Admin status is saved in browser localStorage for 4 hours
- **Multiple admin support**: Up to 3 different admin passcodes for different roles
- **Easy revocation**: Passcodes can be changed instantly by updating the code

### üéØ Protected Operations
All these operations now require admin access:
- **Score editing**: Entering/editing match scores in any tournament phase
- **Match generation**: Creating pool play matches and knockout brackets
- **Tournament management**: Advancing phases, generating random scores, resetting
- **Quick score buttons**: 21-0, 0-21, 21-19 shortcuts

### üîë Admin Passcodes (for tournament day)

## How to Use

### For Tournament Organizers
1. **Share passcodes**: Give admin passcodes to trusted scorekeepers before the tournament
2. **Monitor admin access**: See who is logged in as admin in the top-right corner
3. **Change passcodes if needed**: Update `hooks/use-admin.ts` if access needs to be revoked

### For Scorekeepers
1. **Login**: Click the admin login card in the top-right corner
2. **Enter credentials**: Provide your name and one of the admin passcodes
3. **Keep session active**: Admin status lasts 4 hours, then you'll need to re-login
4. **Score matches**: Edit buttons will now work for updating match scores

### For Players/Spectators
- **Clean viewing experience**: See all tournament data without confusing buttons

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

### Admin Protection Pattern
All protected functions follow this pattern:
```typescript
const someAdminFunction = async () => {
  if (!isAdmin) {
    alert("Admin access required!")
    return
  }
  // ... rest of function
}
```

## Benefits

## Emergency Procedures

### If someone unauthorized gets admin access:
1. **Change passcodes**: Update `hooks/use-admin.ts` and redeploy
2. **Have all admins re-login**: Old sessions will become invalid
3. **Check recent changes**: Review match scores for any suspicious updates

### If admin can't login:
1. **Verify passcode**: Check spelling and capitalization
2. **Clear browser data**: Try incognito/private browsing mode  
3. **Check console**: Browser dev tools may show connection issues
4. **Use backup passcode**: Try the other admin passcodes

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements for future tournaments:
- **Audit log**: Track who changed what scores and when
- **Role-based access**: Different permissions for different admin types
- **Remote passcode changes**: Update passcodes through admin interface
- **Session management**: See all active admin sessions
- **Temporary access**: Generate time-limited admin codes
